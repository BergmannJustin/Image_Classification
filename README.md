# Image-Classification



## Introduction

I coded an image classifier that aims to detect classes in images. The Dataset comprises 100 classes, each containing 600 images. Specifically, there are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class.
So in total there are 60000 Images.

## Purpose-of-use

Image classification is a fundamental concept in image processing and artificial intelligence. It enables automatic categorization of images into different classes or categories based on their visual features. This technique is utilized across various domains to solve complex problems and automate human tasks.

A common application of image classification is object detection and identification. By training models, systems can automatically recognize and identify objects in images. This is employed, for instance, in the automotive industry for autonomous vehicles, in surveillance systems for detecting suspicious behavior, and in medical imaging systems for anomaly identification.
